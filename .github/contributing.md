# Contributing to Leaf

👋 Welcome to the Vapor team!

## Overview

Leaf is a templating language built for Swift. You can read more about it at [docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started/](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/leaf/getting-started/). The `leaf` package integrates the templating language provided by [leaf-kit](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit.git) with Vapor's `View` system.

## Feature Requests

Please read these guidelines before submitting a feature request to Leaf. Due to the large volume of issues we receive, feature requests that do not follow these guidelines will be closed.

### Do:

- ✅ Clearly define a problem currently affecting Leaf users.

> Make it clear what you are currently _not able_ to do with Leaf and why you think this matters to most people using it.

- ✅ Clearly define a solution, with plenty of examples.

> Show what a solution to this problem looks like to use. Pretend you are writing documentation for it.

- ✅ Propose more than one solution.

> If you have lots of ideas, share them. They will help in the brainstorming process.

- ✅ Relate the problem and solution to Leaf's existing APIs.

> Explain clearly how your feature would fit in with the rest of what Leaf offers.

- ✅ Show examples from other templating languages.

> If the feature you are requesting exists in other templating languages, include examples. This will help everyone understand the idea better as well as provide additional sources of inspiration.

### Do not:

- ❌ Submit large PRs without discussion first.

> Give everyone a chance to understand your idea and get on the same page before submitting code. This can be through a GitHub issue or the Swift forums. 

## SemVer

Vapor follows [SemVer](https://semver.org). This means that any changes to the source code that can cause existing code to stop compiling _must_ wait until the next major version to be included.

Code that is only additive and will not break any existing code can be included in the next minor release.
