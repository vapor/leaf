# ``Leaf``

Leaf provides integrations between [LeafKit](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit) and [Vapor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor) to make it easy to use Leaf templates in your Vapor app. It provides extensions to make it easy to set up, configure and use Leaf as your renderer in Vapor. It also conforms ``LeafRenderer`` to ``ViewRenderer`` so it can be used to render generic Views in Vapor.
